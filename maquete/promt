Create a modern, professional, multi-page personal portfolio website using only HTML and Tailwind CSS.
Do NOT use any JavaScript frameworks, React, Vue, or Laravel — only pure HTML and Tailwind (via CDN).

🎯 Objective:
Build a complete, responsive, and visually stunning developer portfolio that includes at least three pages:
1. Home
2. Projects
3. Project Details
(Optional: About or Contact page)

All pages must share the same modern design system, consistent colors, typography, and layout.

🧩 OUTPUT STRUCTURE:

/portfolio/ ├── index.html ├── projects.html ├── project-details.html ├── about.html (optional) ├── contact.html (optional) └── /images/ (for placeholder images)


Each page must have a `<head>` (with Tailwind CDN and font link), `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.

Make the design **look like a professional developer’s portfolio** — clean, modern, minimalist, and ready to showcase real projects.
